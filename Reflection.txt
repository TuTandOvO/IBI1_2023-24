During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!

During the git exploring procedure, I find that it is very interesting to make connections between remote database and local repository.

What impressed me most is the graph making procedure. The graph contains so many interesting points that I want learn more and more.
