This is an example file for reflection in IBI1_2023-24.

During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!

During the git exploring procedure, I find that it is very interesting to make connections between remote database and local repository.
